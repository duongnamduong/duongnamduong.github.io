I am a Research and Development Engineer at [Institute of Research and Technology b-com](https://b-com.com/), where I am currently working on Augmented Reality and Computer Vision projects for Industry and Healthcare 4.0. 
Also here, I worked as a PhD student for three years and defensed successfully my PhD degree in Signal, Image, Vision at [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/), France. My research focuses on Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, and especially developing real-time algorithms for camera localization and relocalization.

Earlier, I got my Master's degree in Image Processing co-organised by [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/) and [Sorbonne University](http://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/) as well as my bachelor's degree in Information and Communication System at [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://en.hust.edu.vn/).

I am interested in building intelligent systems that make sense to society.
