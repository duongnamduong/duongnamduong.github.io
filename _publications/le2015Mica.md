In this paper, we describe the system including image preprocessing, feature descriptor extraction, classification method and fusion techniques that we applied for LifeCLEF 2015-multi-organ plant identification task. In the preprocessing step, we apply relevant preprocessing techniques for each type of plantsâ€™ organs based on the characteristic of the organs. For the feature descriptor, we propose to use kernel descriptor (KDES) with different types of kernel for all organs types. For flower and entire images, we combine KDES with HSV histogram. At the image level, we apply Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classification method. Finally, we investigate different late fusion techniques in order to build the retrieved observation list.
