First-person hand activity recognition plays a significant role in the computer vision field with various applications. Thanks to recent advances in depth sensors, several 3D skeleton-based hand activity recognition methods using supervised Deep Learning (DL) have been proposed, proven effective when a large amount of labeled data is available. However, the annotation of such data remains difficult and costly, which motivates the use of unsupervised methods. We propose in this paper a new approach based on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for 3D skeleton hand activity clustering. It aims at exploiting the knowledge-driven from labeled samples of the source domain to categorize the unlabeled ones of the target domain. To this end, we introduce a novel metric learning-based loss function to learn a highly discriminative representation while preserving a good activity recognition accuracy on the source domain. The learned representation is used as a low-level manifold to cluster unlabeled samples. In addition, to ensure the best clustering results, we proposed a statistical and consensus-clustering-based strategy. The proposed approach is experimented on the real-world FPHA data set.
